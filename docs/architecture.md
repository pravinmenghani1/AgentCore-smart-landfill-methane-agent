```

## AgentCore Integration

### Agent Orchestrator
- **Lifecycle Management**: Handles agent startup, shutdown, and health monitoring
- **Message Routing**: Intelligent routing of messages between agents based on type
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes workload across agent instances
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery and agent restart capabilities

### Message System
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Non-blocking message passing between agents
- **Type-based Routing**: Messages routed based on content type and destination
- **Persistence**: Message queuing for reliability and replay capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Real-time message flow tracking and performance metrics

## Strands SDK Components

### Reasoning Engine (Planner Agent)
- **AI Models**: Advanced methane prediction using machine learning
- **Context Awareness**: Incorporates historical data and environmental factors
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability metrics for predictions
- **Explanation Generation**: Creates human-readable reasoning for decisions

### Validation Engine (Safety Guard)
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in EPA and environmental regulations
- **Constraint Checking**: Multi-dimensional safety parameter validation
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates potential consequences of proposed actions
- **Audit Trails**: Detailed validation logs for compliance reporting

### Action Engine (Executor Agent)
- **Simulation Mode**: Safe testing environment for action validation
- **Execution Strategies**: Multiple action types with configurable parameters
- **Timeout Management**: Prevents stuck operations with automatic recovery
- **Result Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of action outcomes

### Document Engine (Evidence Agent)
- **Template System**: Regulatory-compliant document templates
- **Multi-format Output**: PDF, JSON, XML generation capabilities
- **Retention Policies**: Automated compliance with data retention requirements
- **Digital Signatures**: Cryptographic verification of evidence integrity

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Sensor Data Ingestion
```
Sensor Reading → Message(type="sensor_reading") → AgentCore Router → Planner Agent
```

### 2. AI-Powered Analysis
```
Planner Agent → Strands Reasoning Engine → Prediction + Confidence → Action Plan
```

### 3. Safety Validation
```
Action Plan → Safety Guard → Strands Validation Engine → Compliance Check
```

### 4. Action Execution
```
Validated Plan → Executor Agent → Strands Action Engine → Simulated Execution
```

### 5. Evidence Generation
```
Executed Action → Evidence Agent → Strands Document Engine → Compliance Reports
```
